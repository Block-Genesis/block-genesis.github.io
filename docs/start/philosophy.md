# Philosophy of Genesis Block

Genesis Block does not provide concrete answers. We are here to ask better questions.

This is because there are no simple, one-size-fits-all answers to the questions we're interested in learning about and teaching. That is what makes them good questions.

Our intention is to give you the framework to begin thinking in transformative ways about the most important questions raised by this Web3 world we're building, together.

Students will separate themselves by their ability to identify patterns.

## Pattern Recognition

Pattern recognition is at the core of cognition. Becoming more conscious of patterns which already exist, as well as how you choose to interact with those in your local environment, is the single best thing you can do to improve your critical thinking skills.

In particular, we hope students begin thinking in terms of complementary opposites.

Rather than using dualities like 'decentralization good, centralization bad'; or 'DeFi is innovative, fiat is boring', this style of thinking recognizes that there is no good without evil; no attraction without repulsion, no North with South, no up without down.

We could describe this as "quantum thought" - being able to contemplate both 0 and 1 simultaneously, and the spectrum of probability between. This is not about just both/and thinking, or seeing "both sides" of a debate. It's seeing both sides and the entire spectrum of possible states between without grasping after certainty. This lack of certainty humbles you and it is precisely this humility, coupled with wider perspective of the total spectrum of possible outcomes which can lead you to make more effective decisions.

## Cypherpunks Movement

Cypherpunks are a collection of activists that advocate for the use of privacy-enhancing technologies such as cryptography for social and political change. In 1992 Eric Hughes, Timothy C. May, and John Gilmore founded a small group of cryptographers that would meet in person in San Francisco and adopted the name "Cypherpunks".

The Cypherpunks mailing list was created in the same year as an active forum for technical discussion on topics like cryptography, math, computer science, politics, and philosophy.

Cypherpunks generally hold Libertarian political views and many believe in the idea of crypto-anarchism outlined in Timothy C. May’s The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto (1992).

May mentions that new technologies "will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation."

He also states that the technology for this social and economic revolution has existed in theory since the 1980’s, but "the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable."

In 1993, Eric Hughes released A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto which outlined the core principles of the Cypherpunk movement. Some of the most significant statements are included below:

* "Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age."
* "Privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system."
* "Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography. If I say something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it."
* "We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence."
* "We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems. We are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money."
* 
To summarize, the Cypherpunks mission is to build open source systems designed to defend privacy for everyone in this technological era. They believe that individuals should have the power to reveal their identity and words only when desired, and that neither governments nor corporations can sufficiently protect this right.

The Cypherpunk movement is directly responsible for the creation of digital currency, blockchain technology, and Bitcoin. All four founders of the Bitcoin precursors mentioned above (Adam Back, Nick Szabo, Wei Dai, and David Chaum) were Cypherpunks that first proposed their ideas through the mailing list.
