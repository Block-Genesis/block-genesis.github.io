# Guide to the University

Creating and building is not limited to code. In web3, you can be involved and create anything you like: from custom tools to protocol analysis, from artful memes to a community of your own, and everything in between.

The curriculum is here to ground us all in common fundamental threads so we can share the same core concepts together. Such shared concepts allow each person to explore their particular specialized skill more fully, and provide the minimum structure required to give you direction without coercion.

In the beginning, it's easy to become overwhelmed in the flood of new information. The team recognizes this and are here to support you every step of the way. So don't be afraid to ask for help.

## Tips and Tricks

Here are some suggestions for ways to approach your learning journey:

1. In the first week, you will be exposed to new teammates and many mind-altering ideas. **It will feel overwhelming**. There will be a lot of information overload. Simply be overwhelmed, without trying to fight the feeling and ending up anxious and constantly trying to catch up. We all started the same way. With enough repetition and practice, you **will** get it.

2. Throughout each week, realize that there will simply be too many things happening for you to keep up with. This is normal and expected: don't worry about missing some events in the space or at work in general.

3. As you can choose to be involved in any aspect of the protocols we are working on, the easiest way to navigate this is by being intentional about your own expectations. Spend the first few weeks meeting the team, exchanging ideas, and just listening and talking. Let all the new influences wash over you and inform what you want to do.

4. Write your intention for your own goals down. Write it down again at the start of each new week. It's completely okay to change it as many times as you like, but these kinds of rituals can help ground us and provide clarity.

5. Be honest with yourself. You will be exposed with all the good, all the bad, and all the drama in the space. Tell your peers how you're feeling. No one will judge you for it. We are all here for the long haul. We do not expect you to love every moment of crypto journey or feel totally engaged the whole time. A large part of this is simply just learning.

6. Be kind to yourself and others. In a shared network, this is the galaxy brain move. "Practice kindness all day to everybody and you will realize youâ€™re already in heaven now."
