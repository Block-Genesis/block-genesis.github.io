# Getting Started

Genesis Block is a 4 week program, and we'll be covering a 2 new learning modules each week. Each module is made up of three sections: **Crafted Reading**, which we will expect you to have read before the beginning of each new week; **Curated Material** which is made up of articles, videos, and the occasional podcast that we highly recommend you go over; and a **Fireside Chat** where a mentor presents and discusses the concepts.

The Learn track aims to provide a more holistic framing of what Web3 is â€” its principles, history, and present state. We know that different people learn differently, hence the mix of text, video and audio. You will need to have read all pieces in the "Crafted Readings" to participate fully in this week's "Fireside Chat" and activities. The "Curated Material" is highly recommended if you are the sort of person who feels like they might want to add value to any of the spontaneous conversations which no doubt will spring up in the course of the work.
