# NEAR

NEAR Protocol is a public blockchain and smart contract platform built to host high-throughput decentralized applications. It uses an sharding to scale the network and improve the overall user experience. NEAR, of the same name, is the native currency that holders can use to pay the costs associated with deploying applications or submitting transactions. The NEAR token also plays a central role in the platform's Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, where participants can stake tokens on the network to increase its cost of attack. Similar to Ethereum, the concept of gas is also used to pay for computation and mitigate spam. Accounts also pay storage rent which accumulates over time and is charged once the account submits a transaction for processing. Storage rent is charged for data and also as a tax on short account names to discourage name squatting.

In a block, transactions are split into chunks, one chunk per shard. A block is the accumulation of all chunks. Chunks are validated by nodes that maintain the state of that shard. Each logical block will theoretically contain all transactions for all shards. Each network participant maintains the state that corresponds to the shards that they validate transactions for and any additional shard that they want to track, since transmitting a logical block across the network would be expensive.

For consensus, once a block producer publishes a block, they collect the signatures of the validator nodes, then the weight of a block is determined by the cumulative stake of all the signers whose signatures are included in the block. Thus, consensus is based on the heaviest chain, as the weight of a chain is the sum of the block weights. Additionally, the consensus utilizes the Nightshade Finality Gadget, which introduces additional slashing conditions for higher chain security.

**Block Explorer**: https://explorer.near.org/

**Addresses**: Uses readable account IDs instead of a hash of a public key. Account IDs contain a minimum length of 2 with maximum length of 64. Account ID consists of Account ID parts separated by "." and each part consists of lowercase alphanumeric symbols separated by either _ or -. Example: `blockgenesis.near`

**Consensus**: Sharded Proof-of-Stake with blocks constructed with a gadget called Doomslug and a slower finality gadget called Nightshade Finality Gadget.

**NEAR Supply**: No hard cap on the total supply.

**Smart Contracts**: Contracts compile down to WebAssembly (.wasm), which is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine, that are run on a WebAssembly virtual machine. You can therefore use any language that can compile to wasm, but the recommended to use is Rust.

Example contract code:

```rust
/**
* Fungible Token implementation with JSON serialization.
* NOTES:
*  - The maximum balance value is limited by U128 (2**128 - 1).
*  - JSON calls should pass U128 as a base-10 string. E.g. "100".
*  - The contract optimizes the inner trie structure by hashing account IDs. It will prevent some
*    abuse of deep tries. Shouldn't be an issue, once NEAR clients implement full hashing of keys.
*  - This contract doesn't optimize the amount of storage, since any account can create unlimited
*    amount of allowances to other accounts. It's unclear how to address this issue unless, this
*    contract limits the total number of different allowances possible at the same time.
*    And even if it limits the total number, it's still possible to transfer small amounts to
*    multiple accounts.
