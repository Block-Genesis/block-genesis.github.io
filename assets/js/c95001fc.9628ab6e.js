They also require active participation and management from market makers who usually use sophisticated infrastructure and algorithms, limiting participation to advanced traders. Order books were invented in a world with relatively few assets being traded, so it is not surprising they aren't ideal for an ecosystem where anyone can create their own token, and those tokens usually have low liquidity.
