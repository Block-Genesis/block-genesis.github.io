The main chain is called the Cosmos Hub. Creating a Zone is permissionless, but creating a new Hub will most likely require majority agreement. ATOM is the native asset of Cosmos and is used for on-chain governance. Specifically, ATOMs can be staked by Zone validators to join Hubs. Cosmos Hub has a similar gas system and requires ATOM to be used for transaction fees.

The NEAR token also plays a central role in the platform\'s Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, where participants can stake tokens on the network to increase its cost of attack. Similar to Ethereum, the concept of gas is also used to pay for computation and mitigate spam. Accounts also pay storage rent which accumulates over time and is charged once the account submits a transaction for processing. Storage rent is charged for data and also as a tax on short account names to discourage name squatting.","sidebar":"sidebarLearn"},"learn/module-3/other-blockchains":{"id":"learn/module-3/other-blockchains","title":"Other Blockchains","description":"","sidebar":"sidebarLearn"},"learn/module-3/polkadot":{"id":"learn/module-3/polkadot","title":"Polkadot","description":"Polkadot is a heterogeneous multi-chain blockchain designed to offer interoperability and scalability.

Defaulting on a loan or any sort of debt obligation is when the borrower fails to pay back the loan according to the original agreement. In other words, the borrower has continuously missed payments on the debt over an extended period of time. Lenders sometimes require the borrower to put up a valuable asset as collateral in which the lender has the right to possess in the instance that the loan defaults. In traditional finance, the most common types of collateral used to secure a loan include real estate, automobiles, art, jewelry, and securities."},"learn/module-4/decentralized-finance":{"id":"learn/module-4/decentralized-finance","title":"Decentralized Finance","description":"","sidebar":"sidebarLearn"},"learn/module-4/liquidity-provision":{"id":"learn/module-4/liquidity-provision","title":"Liquidity Provision","description":"A liquidity pool is a trading venue for a pair or a group of ERC20 tokens.

This first liquidity provider is the one who sets the initial price of the pool. They are incentivized to deposit an equal value of both tokens into the pool. To see why, consider the case where the first liquidity provider deposits tokens at a ratio different from the current market rate. This immediately creates a profitable arbitrage opportunity, which is likely to be taken by an external party.","sidebar":"sidebarLearn"},"learn/module-4/money-markets":{"id":"learn/module-4/money-markets","title":"Money Markets","description":"","sidebar":"sidebarLearn"},"learn/module-4/stablecoins":{"id":"learn/module-4/stablecoins","title":"Stablecoins","description":"","sidebar":"sidebarLearn"},"learn/module-4/tokens-and-programmable-assets":{"id":"learn/module-4/tokens-and-programmable-assets","title":"Tokens and Programmable Assets","description":"Technically, \\"token\\" is just another word for \\"cryptocurrency\\" or \\"cryptoasset.\\" But increasingly it has taken on a couple of more specific meanings depending on context.
