Dapps will be able to choose which shard they want to run on. It is designed to have a main chain, called the Beacon Chain, and pegged to the Beacon Chain are several sub-chains or shards. Shards would need to go through the Beacon Chain should they want to communicate with each other, thus cross-shard communication, although possible, is not encouraged as it is slow. The minimum staking threshold for validators is 32 ETH. Validators will be assigned to shards and divided into block proposers and committees. A block proposer is a validator that has been pseudorandomly selected to build a block. Most of the time, validators are attesters that vote on beacon blocks and shard blocks. These votes are recorded in the Beacon Chain. The votes determine the head of the Beacon Chain, and the heads of shards. A committee is a group of validators which attempt to crosslink a particular shard. A crosslink is a reference in a beacon block to a shard block, and it is how the Beacon Chain follows the head of a shard chain. All shard chains are following the Beacon Chain at all times as the Beacon chain will be treated as the "single source of truth".'),(0,o.kt)("p",null,(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Block Explorer"),": ",(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://etherscan.io/"},"https://etherscan.io/")),(0,o.kt)("p",null,(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Addresses"),': "0x" prefix concatenated with the rightmost 20 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the ECDSA public key.
